## What is an "event"?

## Let's work with Events!
- what codebase are we working with?
- click on document and explore events object
- submit our form

## .addEventListener() on a DOM node
- takes in a string for the name of the event, and a callback function to be invoked when the event happens
- (optional) argument for the callback function is the event itself

## When to add an event Listener
- on load of page?
- on creation of element?

## Some events have default behavior
- event.preventDefault()

## event.currentTarget vs. event.target
- event.currentTarget: the HTML element addEventListener is attached to
- event.target: the innermost node that triggers the event
