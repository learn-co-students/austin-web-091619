# Planning React Components, State and Props


## State

- Components with forms/interactions
- Components that fetch data

## Callbacks

- In the parent component create callback functions to change fetched data
- Pass function down as props to children

## Steps:

1. Decide the components and their relationships.
2. Determine state and props from App down to components.
3. Determine if you need callbacks to send data from children to parents.
